            <li>1/2 cup molasses</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>3 cups of sifted flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>12 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat margarine and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer
                on low speed until mostly incorporated, 1 ro 2 minutes. Increase
                speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, another 2 
                to 3 minutes. Beat in egg yolk,then molasses.
                <li>Whisk sifted flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon,
                    cloves,ginger, and nutmeg in a separate bowl until well combined
                    . Gradually add flour mixture to the molasses mixture, beating until
                    well blended and smooth.
                    <li>Divide dough in half and form each into a 1-inch-thick disk.
                        Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 fo 3 hours, or 
                        overnight.
                        <li>When ready to bake,preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
                        <li>Working with one disk at a time, abd leaving remaining disk in the
                            refrigerator, unwrap chilled dough and place on a lightly floured surface.
                             Working from the center edges roll dough with a floured rolling pin to a thickness
                             of 1/4 inch.
                             <li>Cut dough into desired shapes with cookie cutters, dipping the cutters into
                                flour as needed so they don't stick to the dough. Fit the cookie cutters as closely
                                together as possible to cut as many cookies as you can. This will minimize the number
                                of times you have to re=roll the dough.
                                <li>Transfer gingerbread  cookies to un-greased cookie sheet spacing then 2 inches apart.
                                    <li>Frost or decorate cooled gingerbread cookies as desired.</li>
